TASS Movidius uses pretrained **Inception V3 & Yolo models** and an **Intel® Movidius** to carry out object and **facial classification**, both locally and on a live webcam stream. TASS Movidius uses the [IoT JumpWay](https://iot.techbubbletechnologies.com "IoT JumpWay") for IoT communication and publishes messages to the broker when an object is identified.
