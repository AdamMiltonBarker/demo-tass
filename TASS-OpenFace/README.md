## IoT JumpWay Device / Application Connection Credentials & Settings

- Follow the [TechBubble Technologies IoT JumpWay Developer Program (BETA) Location Application Doc](https://github.com/TechBubbleTechnologies/IoT-JumpWay-Docs/blob/master/5-Location-Applications.md "TechBubble Technologies IoT JumpWay Developer Program (BETA) Location Application Doc") to set up your IoT JumpWay Location Application.

- Setup an IoT JumpWay Location Device for each IP camera you will be connecting to, and / or your Realsense camera. For this example, we only require the device ID for each camera, we will not be using the MQTT details for each camera as the application is capable of sending data on behalf of any device in its location. Follow the [TechBubble Technologies IoT JumpWay Developer Program (BETA) Location Device Doc](https://github.com/TechBubbleTechnologies/IoT-JumpWay-Docs/blob/master/4-Location-Devices.md "TechBubble Technologies IoT JumpWay Developer Program (BETA) Location Device Doc") to set up your devices.

## Preparing Training Data For Your Neural Network

To help solve the open set recognition issue (See KNOWN ISSUES below), we have provided 500 images from the [Labeled Faces in the Wild Dataset](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/ "Labeled Faces in the Wild Dataset"), this has been tested in small environments, but may not be an accurate solution in larger environments where there is more chance of someone resembling one of the unknown photos. All that remains for you to do is to collect your training data and add it to the training folder ready for training.

Create 1 or more folders in the training/1 directory, these folders will represent classes, and there should be 1 folder / class per person, name the folder using something that will allow you identify who the photos are of, the name of the folder / class will be used by the program to let you know who it has detected. You can use names, user IDs or anything you like for the folder / class names, but bear in mind privacy. We have successfully tested with 10 training images per class, but your application may need more or less than this.

## Training Your Neural Network

Now you have added your training data, you should train your neural network, navigate to the root of the project and execute the following command:

    $ python TassTrain.py

## Testing Your Neural Network

Before we go any further, we can now test your trained neural network. Add 1 or more images of each person / class you added to the training data into the testing directory, you should try with images that you did not use in the training data. Navigate to the root of the project and execute the following command:

    $ python TassTest.py

If the images you add to the testing directory are not classified correctly after running TassTest.py, you should re train with more examples.

## Using 1 Or More IP Cameras

Ensure you have set up your IP camera devices and added the settings correctly to your config.json as mentioned above, then navigate to the root of the project and execute the following command:

    $ python TassCore.py

The program will initiate and your live streams will be processed. First the program will detect if there is a face present in the frame, and then will send the frame through the neural network to detect if it is an intruder or a known person. For trouble shooting, see KNOWN ISSUES and TROUBLE SHOOTING below.

## Using A Realsense Camera

Ensure you have set up your Realsense camera device and added the settings correctly to your config.json as mentioned above, then navigate to the root of the project and execute the following command:

    $ python TassRealsense.py

The program will initiate and your live stream will be processed. First the program will detect if there is a face present in the frame, and then will send the frame through the neural network to detect if it is an intruder or a known person. For trouble shooting, see KNOWN ISSUES and TROUBLE SHOOTING below.

## Seeing What Your Neural Network Sees

In the event that a face is detected, the frame will be saved in the frames folder, bounding boxes will be drawn around all faces that are detected and the frames will be placed into either detected or notdetected directories grouped by date, in addition, frames that have faces detected in them will be stored in the identified / notidentified directories of the respective date and time directories, these frames will not have bounding boxes, so you can use them to retrain your model. You can access these images by connecting to your NUC with SFTP and downloading them to your computer.

## Viewing Your Data

When the program detects a known user or intruder, it will send sensor and warning data for the device it was captured from to the [TechBubble IoT JumpWay](https://iot.techbubbletechnologies.com/ "TechBubble IoT JumpWay"). You will be able to access the data in the [TechBubble IoT JumpWay Developers Area](https://iot.techbubbletechnologies.com/developers/dashboard/ "TechBubble IoT JumpWay Developers Area"). Once you have logged into the Developers Area, visit the [TechBubble IoT JumpWay Location Devices Page](https://iot.techbubbletechnologies.com/developers/location-devices "Location Devices page"), find your device and then visit the Warnings & Sensor Data pages to view the data sent from the application.

## KNOWN ISSUES

1. The Open Set Recognition Issue: The Open Set Recognition Issue is where a neural network will identify someone that it has not been trained on, as someone that it has. In this version of TASS we have seemed to have solved this issue with the use of an unknown class consisting of 500 images of random people from the LFW dataset. In larger environments, this may not solve this issue, but in small environments such as a home or office it should.

2. Lighting: Lighting is unfortunately quite a large problem that we have not been able to solve as of yet. We find we have best results when there is bright light in front of the face.

## TROUBLE SHOOTING

1. If the OpenCV or Dlib do not detect known faces, it is likely that you have a lighting issue, play with the lighting and test in different scenarios.

2. If you see Unable To Classify Frame, it means the Open CV or Dlib were able to detect a face, but the classifier was not able to classify the person. There could be two reasons for this, the need for more training, or lighting. You will find the non classified images in the frames directory, there will be a directory for each hour of the day in this directory, look for the notidentified directory and download the images, add them to your training data for the relevant person / class, and retrain the model.

3. If you see the classifier was unable to classify a known person, the reasons for this could be the same as in point 2 above, repreat the steps provided in that point and see if it helps.
